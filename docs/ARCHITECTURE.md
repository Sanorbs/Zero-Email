# Zero Email Management System Architecture

## Overview
ZEMS is designed to provide automatic email organization without user intervention. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Browser Extension**: Intercepts and enhances the email client UI
2. **Backend Service**: Processes emails and provides smart features
3. **Local Storage**: Maintains search indexes and email metadata

## Data Flow

1. User opens an email in their web client (Gmail/Outlook)
2. Extension content script detects the email view
3. Email content is extracted and sent to background script
4. Background script sends email to backend for processing
5. Backend analyzes email and returns metadata
6. Extension displays enhancements in the UI
7. Email metadata is stored locally for future search

## Key Algorithms

### Email Classification
- Uses natural language processing to categorize emails
- Combines keyword matching with ML classification
- Identifies urgency signals (deadlines, action verbs)

### Smart Search
- Full-text search with relevance scoring
- Context-aware results (prioritizes recent, important emails)
- Natural language query understanding

### Automatic Reminders
- Detects action items in email content
- Schedules reminders based on urgency
- Resurfaces important emails at appropriate times
